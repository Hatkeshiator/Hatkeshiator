# About Me

My name is Varad Kinjal Padipbhai Dixit and I'm just sort of glad to be here.
Hatkeshiator is  **Hatkesh** (my ishtadeva, hatkeshwar mahadeva) + Appre**ciator**

I love The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword. I love the Lord of the Rings books. I grew
up on the internet and I love it here to a fault. I always love to help out but I may
not always be able, either because I'm still learning (improving in general) or I'm
still learning (literally in class at the time).

Formerly a GNU/Linux Mint user for 13 years, then used Windows out of obligation
2020-2023, then switched back to Mint. In June 2025, I switched to **Artix GNU/Linux**
as my daily driver.

I use XMonad WM with a custom configuration file, which you can find in this directory.
I use XLibre fork of X and actively avoid Wayland.
I actively avoid using projects associated with Rust, Wayland, SystemD, and other
inferior replacements of established tools. I make exception only for tools I myself
find useful, such as the Helix text editor.
