## Code of conduct

The primary goal of my whole account is to be a collection of projects into which I invest my time and effort to hone my skill.
All are welcome and you may behave as you please, but there are certain facts you must acknowledge.
Remember that just as you alone are responsible for what you say, you alone too are responsible for how you are treated.
The following few lines are the Oaths of Gigachad:

### "I do not care what people say or think about in and of itself. I only care about hard facts and my own beliefs, and the beliefs of the few dearest to me."
### "Unless you, a stranger I know nothing about, are being stolen from or beaten up, I don't care." 
### "Even if you *are*, it's *still* not my problem and I *still* don't care."
### "I am here for my amusement and/or actualization, and it is those ends alone I shall achieve, regardless of all else."
### "There is no such thing as 'my' code. What is called 'stealing' code is as much a transgression as reading bedtime tales to children."

If you cannot pledge the above, you do not belong here.
Additionally, if you wish to be a refined, discerning gentleman, the following few optional oaths may be undertaken:

### "I shall, to the best of my ability, avoid language that is profane, overly elaborate, or inherently insulting. I shall speak and write in a manner that the youngest of children listening to me shall find me as insightful as the wisest of men."
### "I shall not offer help, for that is beneath me, but I shall certainly try my best to help when asked."
### "I shall not lie or bear false witness; this includes correcting that false witness borne by others."
### "I bear no responsibility or allegiance for actions and words other than my own, and those from the Heavens."
### "I shall not have to be defended by others. I shall make myself always stronger than any foe."
### "I shall sharpen my wit such that I become impossible to lie to."
### "If I fall victim to a scammer or charlatan, or am fleeced, this is my own fault. I shall accept defeat and move on."
