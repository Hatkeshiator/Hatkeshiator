# About Me

My name is Varad Kinjal Padipbhai Dixit and I'm just sort of glad to be here.
Hatkeshiator is  **Hatkesh** (my ishtadeva, hatkeshwar mahadeva) + Appre**ciator**

I love The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword. I love the Lord of the Rings books. I grew
up on the internet and I love it here to a fault. I always love to help out but I may
not always be able, either because I'm still learning (improving in general) or I'm
still learning (literally in class at the time).
